        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that defines the structure and meaning of web content. It's the most basic building block of the web and is used to create web pages. HTML is made up of a series of elements, or tags, that are inserted into a file to tell web browsers how to display the content. 
            To inspect an HTML element, you can right-click on an element or a blank area and select "Inspect". This will show you what elements are made up of, and you can also edit the HTML or CSS in the Elements or Styles panel.
